## Problem: 
> There are 100s if not 1000â€™s of open source sample projects available on Github/Youtube/Udemy for Cloud. 

**Please understand, setting up of these projects is not Cloud. Someone has already created a project and you are just following the instructions of readme to simply install it.**

Dont be delusional about installation and Cloud projects, it takes months to build one project from scratch. You wonâ€™t be able to setup a Cloud project without building it yourself and if youâ€™re not building it yourself then all you are doing is installation. Unfortunately I see a lot of folks failing to understand this difference and as a result get fooled into believing that they created 10-12 projects by themselves in a single training session of couple of months. 

Ps : Samaj-dar bano bhaii, why will companies pay millions to Cloud Engineer if you simply Copy-Paste 10-12 Cloud projects in 2 months and lack basics
